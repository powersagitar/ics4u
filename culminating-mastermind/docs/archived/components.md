# Components

For better organization, the components have been divided into the following categories:

- **Core**: Independent from all GUI components. Responsible for game logic.
- **GUI**: May be dependent on core components. Responsible for user
  interaction.
- **Utility**: Components not strictly related to the project. Helper methods
  for other categories.
