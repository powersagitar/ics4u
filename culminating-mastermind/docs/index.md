This is the wiki for mastermind, the ICS4U culminating project.

The game being implemented is the standard variant of the game, where the solver
has to guess a secret code of length 4 in 10 attempts. The game is played on a
grid, with 6 possible colors and 4 pegs to provide hints. The operator can
choose to make a code and ask the program to guess, or they can ask the program
to make a code and guess themselves.
